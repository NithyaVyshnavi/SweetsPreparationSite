          Kaja is a traditional layered Indian sweet, popular in Andhra Pradesh
          and Telangana. It’s made by folding and deep-frying thin layers of
          dough, then soaking them in sugar syrup. Its flaky, crispy texture
          with a sweet coating makes it a delightful treat.

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix flour and ghee, add water gradually and knead into a soft dough.
            Rest for 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll the dough into thin sheets. Apply a paste of ghee and rice
            flour between layers and roll it tightly like a log.
          </li>
          <li>Cut the rolled dough into 1-inch pieces and flatten slightly.</li>
          <li>
            Heat oil and deep-fry on medium flame until golden and crispy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, prepare sugar syrup by boiling sugar and water until it
            reaches one-string consistency. Add cardamom powder if using.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dip the fried kajas in warm sugar syrup and let them soak for a few
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Remove and let them cool. Serve once syrup sets slightly.</li>
