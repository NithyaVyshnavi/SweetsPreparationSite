          Boondi Laddu is a festive Indian sweet made from tiny fried droplets
          of gram flour (boondi), soaked in sugar syrup and shaped into laddus.

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix besan with water to make a smooth, flowing batter without lumps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a pan. Hold a perforated ladle above the oil and pour
            batter over it to form small droplets (boondi).
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry the boondi until light golden. Remove and drain on paper towels.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate pan, boil sugar and water until it forms a sticky
            one-string consistency syrup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add cardamom and optional fried cashews/raisins to the syrup. Turn
            off heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immediately add fried boondi to the hot syrup and mix well. Let it
            soak for a few minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            While still warm, grease your palms with ghee and shape the mixture
            into laddus.
          </li>
          <li>Let them cool and set. Store in an airtight container.</li>
