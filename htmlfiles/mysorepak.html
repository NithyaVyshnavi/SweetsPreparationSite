        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sieve the besan and dry roast it lightly on low heat until aromatic.
            Keep aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a pan, mix sugar and water. Heat until it forms a one-string
            consistency syrup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually add besan to the syrup while stirring continuously to
            avoid lumps.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate pan, heat ghee and keep adding it little by little to
            the mixture while stirring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue stirring and cooking on medium heat until the mixture
            thickens and starts leaving the sides of the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quickly pour the mixture into a greased tray and level it out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow it to cool slightly, then cut into square or rectangular
            pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let it set completely before serving. Enjoy the rich, ghee-filled
            Mysore Pak!
