          Rasgulla is a soft and spongy Indian dessert made from fresh chenna
          (curdled milk), shaped into balls, and boiled in a light sugar syrup.
          It's a popular Bengali sweet, known for its juicy texture and mildly
          sweet flavor.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 liter full-fat milk</li>
          <li>2–3 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar (to curdle milk)</li>
          <li>1.5 cups sugar</li>
          <li>4 cups water</li>
          <li>2–3 cardamom pods (optional, for aroma)</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon rose water or kewra water (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Boil the milk. Once it starts boiling, reduce heat and add lemon
            juice slowly while stirring.
          </li>
          <li>
            When milk curdles completely, turn off the heat. Strain the curds
            using a muslin cloth. Rinse under cold water to remove lemon flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hang the cloth for 30 minutes to drain excess water, forming soft
            chenna.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knead the chenna gently for 8–10 minutes until smooth and no lumps
            remain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide and roll the mixture into smooth small balls (ensure no
            cracks).
          </li>
          <li>
            In a wide pot, boil 4 cups of water with 1.5 cups sugar and cardamom
            pods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once boiling, add the chenna balls, cover, and cook on medium flame
            for 15 minutes. They will expand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off heat and let them cool in syrup. Add rose or kewra water if
            desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refrigerate for a few hours and serve chilled. Enjoy soft, spongy
            rasgullas!
