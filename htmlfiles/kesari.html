          Kesari, also known as Sooji Halwa or Rava Kesari, is a popular Indian
          dessert made from semolina (rava), sugar, ghee, and flavored with
          saffron or food coloring. Using milk along with water gives it a
          creamy texture and enhances the flavor. It’s often served during
          festivals, celebrations, and as an offering in temples.

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon ghee in a pan. Fry cashews until golden, and fry
            raisins until they puff up. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same pan, roast rava on low flame until aromatic and slightly
            golden. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate pot, boil 1.5 cups water and 1 cup milk together. Add
            saffron strands or food color to the mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slowly add the hot milk-water mix to the roasted rava, stirring
            continuously to avoid lumps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook until the rava absorbs all the liquid and becomes soft and
            fluffy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add sugar and stir well. It will loosen for a while—keep stirring
            until it thickens again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually add ghee while mixing, until the mixture leaves the sides
            of the pan.
          </li>
          <li>Stir in cardamom powder, fried cashews, and raisins.</li>
          <li>Serve hot or warm. Enjoy your creamy, aromatic Kesari!</li>
