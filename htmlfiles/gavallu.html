          Bellam Gavvalu is a traditional Andhra sweet made with wheat flour or
          maida shaped into small shells (gavvalu), deep-fried, and coated in
          thick jaggery syrup. These crunchy and sweet morsels are especially
          made during festivals like Sankranti and Diwali.

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a bowl, mix flour, salt, and ghee. Add water gradually to make a
            smooth, stiff dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pinch small portions of dough and press each on a gavvalu board or
            back of a fork to get shell-like shapes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a pan and deep-fry the shaped gavvalu on medium flame
            until golden and crisp.
          </li>
          <li>
            In another pan, melt jaggery with 1/4 cup water to make a thick
            syrup. Add cardamom powder and mix well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the fried gavvalu into the hot jaggery syrup and stir quickly so
            they are well-coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer to a plate and let them cool down. They harden slightly and
            turn deliciously chewy and crunchy.
          </li>
          <li>Store in an airtight container and enjoy for days!</li>
